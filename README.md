# MACCA, TOWERS OF GLORY

## Objective
Build a tower that reaches the target weight. Each piece has a specific weight, so think carefully about how you stack them!  
Pile up as many pieces as possible to meet the required weight and use the board controls to move the cubes strategically.

## Controls (Mouse Only)
- **Mouse** -> Move view  
- **Mouse Click** -> Use / Drag controls  
  *(Some levels require dragging for effects)*

## Game Description
Your goal is to build the heaviest tower possible within the time limit. Be careful! The first blocks will be easy to stack, but as time passes, it will become harder to fit new blocks on top.  
Use the physical controls, buttons, and levers to move the device that positions the blocks.  
The game measures weight in kilograms (kg). Each block has a specific weight, and you must reach the target weight to win.
